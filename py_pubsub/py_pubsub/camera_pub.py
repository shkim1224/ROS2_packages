    Detect an object in a video stream and publish its coordinates
    from the perspective of the camera (i.e. camera reference frame)
    Note: You don't need a camera to run this node. This node just demonstrates how to create
    a publisher node in ROS2 (i.e. how to publish data to a topic in ROS2).
    -------
    Publish the coordinates of the centroid of an object to a topic:
      /pos_in_cam_frame â€“ The position of the center of an object in centimeter coordinates
